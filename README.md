This is a no frills 16 color theme for VIM with no explicit color codes. Tested
using Solarized terminal colors.

# Thanks to

This theme has borrowed heavily both code and concept wise from the [noctu](
https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu) and
[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) color schemes.
